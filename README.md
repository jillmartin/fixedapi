Render the data of your API via REACT by following the steps we went over on Thursday:
1. Create an index.html file and serve it up at localhost:3000 of your app (Google: Express static files)
2. Include all libraries (React, Babel & Axios) through CDN script links in your index.html
3. Create a javascript file for your own code and include it in your index.html file as well
4. Use the documentation of the different libraries to write the code to render your API data
5. Ask when you get stuck :slightly_smiling_face:
